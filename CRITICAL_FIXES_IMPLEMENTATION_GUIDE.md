## 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Need to Complete)

### 3. Payment Integration Controllers
**Status:** Partially complete

**What's Needed:**
- PaymentController with methods for:
  - `initiate()` - Start payment process
  - `success()` - Handle successful payment
  - `failed()` - Handle failed payment
  - `razorpayWebhook()` - Razorpay webhook handler
  - `phonepeWebhook()` - PhonePe webhook handler
  - `paytmWebhook()` - Paytm webhook handler
  - `cashfreeWebhook()` - Cashfree webhook handler

### 4. Inventory Locking
**Status:** Not started

**What's Needed:**
Update `CheckoutController@placeOrder` to prevent overselling:

```php
DB::transaction(function () use ($cartItems, $order) {
    foreach ($cartItems as $item) {
        // Lock the product row
        $product = Product::where('id', $item->product_id)
            ->lockForUpdate()
            ->first();
        
        // Check stock
        if ($product->stock < $item->quantity) {
            throw new \Exception("Insufficient stock for {$product->name}");
        }
        
        // Decrement stock
        $product->decrement('stock', $item->quantity);
    }
    
    // Create order
    $order->save();
});
```

### 5. Authorization Policies
**Status:** Not started

**What's Needed:**
Create Laravel Policies for:
- Order (customers can only view their own orders)
- Address (customers can only manage their own addresses)
- Cart (customers can only access their own cart)

## 🔐 SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### Rate Limiting Added:
| Endpoint | Limit | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| OTP Verification | 5/min | Prevents brute force |
| OTP Resend | 3/min | Prevents spam |
| Login | 5/min | Prevents brute force |
| Password Reset | 3/10min | Prevents abuse |
| Live Search | 20/min | Prevents API abuse |
| Email OTP API | 10/min | Prevents spam |

### Route Security:
- ✅ Debug endpoints only in local environment
- ✅ Address routes require authentication
- ✅ Order routes require customer authentication
- ✅ Admin routes require admin authentication

---

## 💳 PAYMENT FLOW

### Customer Flow:
1. Customer adds items to cart
2. Goes to checkout
3. Fills shipping details
4. Selects payment method (Razorpay/PhonePe/Paytm/Cashfree)
5. Order is created with status "pending"
6. Customer redirected to payment gateway
7. Pays using UPI/Card/Netbanking
8. Gateway sends webhook to our server
9. Order status updated to "paid"
10. Customer receives confirmation email

### Admin Flow:
1. Admin adds payment gateway credentials
2. Activates gateway with toggle
3. Gateway becomes available at checkout
4. Admin can view all transactions in order management
