# âœ… Routes Fixed Successfully!

## The Problem Was:
The route `addresses.store` wasn't defined because I put it under the `customer.` prefix by mistake, making it `customer.addresses.store`.

## What I Fixed:
1. âœ… Added separate address routes without prefix
2. âœ… Fixed route naming to match existing views
3. âœ… Removed duplicate address routes
4. âœ… Cleared route cache

## All Routes Working Now:

- `/` - Home page
- `/shop` - Shop listing
- `/shop/{category}` - Category products
- `/product/{id}` - Product details
- `/cart` - Shopping cart

### âœ… Address Routes (Fixed):
