## 🔐 Important Security Notes:

1. **Always start with TEST mode**
   - Use test API keys first
   - Switch to LIVE mode only when ready for production

2. **Keep Keys Secure**
   - Never share your API keys
   - Don't commit them to version control
   - Store them safely in the database

3. **Test Before Going Live**
   - Use test UPI IDs provided by gateways
   - Verify payments work correctly
   - Check webhook integration
