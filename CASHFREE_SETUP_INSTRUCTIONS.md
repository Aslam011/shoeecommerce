# Cashfree Payment Gateway Integration - Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ Integration Complete

The Cashfree Payment Gateway has been fully integrated into your Laravel application with QR code payment support.

## üîß Setup Steps

### 1. Add Environment Variables

Copy the following to your `.env` file:

```env
# Cashfree Payment Gateway
CASHFREE_APP_ID=TEST1009536209069b06bcee13c3314026359001
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=cfsk_ma_test_eb114ea0d55239b8c23afd9334d242df_ed2e3356
CASHFREE_ENV=sandbox
CASHFREE_API_VERSION=2023-08-01
```

### 2. Clear Configuration Cache

Run these commands:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

### 3. Database Migration (if needed)

Make sure your `orders` table has these columns:
- `payment_session_id` (nullable string)
- `payment_transaction_id` (nullable string)
- `payment_status` (string)

If not, run:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## üéØ How It Works

### Payment Flow:

1. **Checkout**: Customer fills checkout form and selects Cashfree as payment method
2. **Order Creation**: System creates order with status "pending_payment"
3. **Cashfree Integration**: 
   - Calls Cashfree Create Order API
   - Generates unique order ID (FORMAT: `ORDER_{order_id}_{timestamp}`)
   - Receives payment session ID
4. **QR Code Generation**: 
   - Calls Cashfree Pay API with UPI QR code option
   - Displays QR code on professional payment page
5. **Payment Detection**: 
   - Automatic polling every 3 seconds to check payment status
   - OR webhook receives notification from Cashfree
6. **Order Completion**: 
   - When payment status = "PAID", order marked as paid
   - Customer redirected to success page

## üîó Important URLs

### Webhook URL (for Cashfree Dashboard):
```
https://yourdomain.com/cashfree/webhook
```

**Configure this in Cashfree Dashboard:**
1. Login to Cashfree Dashboard
2. Go to Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Add webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/cashfree/webhook`
4. Enable "Order Paid" event

### Routes Created:
- Payment Page: `/payment/{order_id}/cashfree`
- Generate QR: `/payment/{order_id}/generate-qr`
- Check Status: `/payment/{order_id}/check-cashfree-status`
- Webhook: `/cashfree/webhook` (CSRF exempt)
- Success Page: `/order-success/{order_id}`

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `config/cashfree.php` - Configuration file
2. `app/Services/CashfreeService.php` - API integration service
3. `resources/views/payment/cashfree.blade.php` - Payment page with QR code

### Modified:
1. `.env.example` - Added Cashfree credentials
2. `app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php` - Updated payment flow
3. `routes/web.php` - Added payment routes
4. `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php` - Exempt webhook from CSRF
5. `resources/views/order-success.blade.php` - Added transaction ID display

## üîê Security Features

‚úÖ Secret key stored in .env (never exposed to frontend)
‚úÖ Webhook signature verification
‚úÖ Server-side API calls only
‚úÖ CSRF protection (except webhook)
‚úÖ Order ownership verification

## üß™ Testing in Sandbox

### Test the flow:
1. Add products to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Select "Cashfree" as payment method
4. Place order
5. QR code will be displayed
6. Use any UPI test app in sandbox mode to scan and pay
7. Payment will be detected automatically
8. You'll be redirected to success page

### Sandbox Details:
- Environment: Sandbox (test mode)
- No real money is charged
- Use test UPI apps or Cashfree test cards

## üöÄ Going to Production

When ready to go live:

1. Get Production credentials from Cashfree:
   - Login to Cashfree Dashboard
   - Switch to Production mode
   - Get Production App ID and Secret Key

2. Update `.env`:
```env
CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_production_app_id
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_production_secret_key
CASHFREE_ENV=production
```

3. Configure Production Webhook:
   - Add production webhook URL in Cashfree Dashboard
   - Ensure your domain is live and HTTPS enabled

4. Clear cache:
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

## üí∞ Settlement

- Payments go to your Cashfree account balance first
- Cashfree settles to your linked bank account:
  - **Sandbox**: T+1 (next day)
  - **Production**: As per your settlement cycle (typically T+1 or T+2)

## üìä Order Status Flow

```
pending_payment ‚Üí PAID (via webhook/polling) ‚Üí processing ‚Üí shipped ‚Üí delivered
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### QR Code not showing?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify .env credentials are correct
- Run `php artisan config:clear`

### Payment not detected?
- Check webhook is configured in Cashfree Dashboard
- Verify webhook URL is accessible (not localhost for production)
- Check logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`

### Webhook not working?
- Ensure URL is HTTPS in production
- Check webhook signature verification
- Verify CSRF exemption is in place
- Check server logs
